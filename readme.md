# TF2Stadium theme for ghost

This repository contains the source files required to create the final theme.
You can either compile the theme on your own or head to [our repository](https://github.com/TF2Stadium/Ghost-Environment) for a quick installation of a developer enviroment.

The theme uses [materialize](http://materializecss.com/) as the CSS framework.

## Files

* Images go in `images`
* Javascript goes in `js`
* Scss goes in `css/main.scss`. Anything else will not get compiled, so make sure to reference it in that file.
* Fonts go in `fonts`
* Templates for ghost go in `templates`
* All the other files (i.e. `package.json`) you want to include go in the root.
